      <p> Hello, my name is Monica Ocampo and I am a Communication Design major,
        and my concentration is Visual Design. If I am not at school and
        doing homework, I also work part-time as a barista so I will
        most likely be found behind the bar. I like to draw, listen to music,
        cook, and read during my free time.</p>
