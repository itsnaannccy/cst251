			<h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
				<p>The purpose of Lab 7 is to know how to create an CSS folder and file
        and know how to style the contents of a index.html file. We are also
        expected to know how to use classes and id's to style specific parts of
        an html file as well as other styling techniques to make our webpages
        look clean and organized for the user.</p>
			<h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
				<p>We did not face many challenges while working on our lab 7, as our
        instructions were straightforward. The main thing was just getting our
        workspace set up and deciding what CSS styles we wanted to include in our
        index.css.</p>
			<h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
