  			<h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
  				<p>The purpose Lab 12 is to be able to experiment with more advanced
          block-level styling and to be able to style different elements within our
          CSS file and manipulate certain tags and attributes.</p>
  			<h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
  				<p>We didn't face any challenges when completing Lab 12, it was just a
          matter of getting everything organized. </p>
  			<h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
