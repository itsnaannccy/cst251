            whole life. However, I have traveled outside the area, to Lake
             Tahoe (where I flew in a helicopter and rode snowmobiles durning the winter),
             Las Vegas, Zion National Park. I have also traveled out of the
             country to Mexico. Another fact about me is I'm Bilingual, my first language is
             Espa√±ol. Over the summer, I was begining to learn the italian language.
