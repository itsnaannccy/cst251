  			<h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
  				<p>The purpose of Lab 8 is to be able to understand how
  				work with CSS selectors and to know when and how to use
  				id and class attributes. We are also expected to know how to
  				organize and style our page.</p>
  			<h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
  				<p>The challenges that we faced while working on this lab were
  				trying to organize and see which elements had classes and how to
  				style them without overriding other classes and ids. We had a bit
  				of trouble with the .image class attribute as it was interfering
  				with another tag but we were eventually able to fix it.</p>
  			<h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
  				<p>Results of Lab 8 are displayed </p>
