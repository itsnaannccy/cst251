 					<h1>Lab 3 File structures</h1>
					<h2>Purpose:</h2>
						<p>In this lab, we had to create a local file structure on my computer
								and add index.html files.</p>
					<h2>Challenges: </h2>
						<p>While working on the lab, there weren't many challenges that we faced
						as many of the files had been created prior to starting the lab.We only
						had questions regarding the screenshots that we need to include as well
				 		as the overall structure, however, we were quickly able to resolve the issues. </p>
					<h2>Results: </h2>
						<p> You are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file
							structure:</p>
