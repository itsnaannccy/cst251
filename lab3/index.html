 					<h1>Lab 3 File structures</h1>
						<p>In this lab, we had to create a local file structre on my computer
								and add index.html files.</p>
					<h2>Challenges </h2>
						<p>A challenge I thought I would face was that my image wouldn't show up
							on the browser. I opened file, copy an image, pasted it under img folder
							in CST-251. I was able to reference that img and it was able to show up
							in my browser. </p>
					<h2>Results </h2>
						<p> you are looking at the index.html file i crated. here is the file
							structure:</p>

					<img src="img/file-structure.png"width="500">
					<h3>Screeenshot of source code of cst251/lab3/index.html </h3>
					<img src="img/index-html.png"width="500">
					<h3>Screenshot of cst251/lab3/index.html on the browser </h3>
					<img src="img/index-browser.png"width="500">
					<h3>Screenshot of source code of cst251/index.html </h3>
