	<h1 class="main-title">Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>

	<h2>Purpose:</h2>
		<p>The purpose of Lab 4 was to be able to create an index.html and to be able to
		upload images onto our local machine and be able to display them in the browser.
	 	Once all the files and images loaded correctly onto the browser, and any problems
		were fixed, the local files were then uploaded to a server.</p>
	<h2>Challenges: </h2>
		<p>Some of the few challenges that we faced were just the small details of making
		sure that all of the links in our main index.html connected to our link for Lab 4
		and vice versa. We also had to make sure that all of the images loaded correctly
		in our browser and that they displayed correctly both in our browser and on the server.</p>
	<h2>Results: </h2>
